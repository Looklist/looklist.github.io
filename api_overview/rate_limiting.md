# Rate Limiting

Looklist rate-limits api requests based on both IP address and ```apiToken```.

During our api beta period, exact rate limits will not be published.  Please use common sense and don't bombard the api with requests.  If you think you'll need a high rate limit for your app please contact us at [dev@lookli.st](mailto:dev@lookli.st) **before** your app is in production.
