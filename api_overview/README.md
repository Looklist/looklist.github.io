# Overview

The Looklist API is REST-like.

## Beta

While the api is in beta, we make no guarantees of uptime, or that shit won't abruptly break at any point.  Consider yourself warned.

While in beta, the api is free to use.  You'll just need to get in touch with us about getting an ```apiToken``` : [dev@lookli.st](mailto:dev@lookli.st)

## Base URL

All requests to the API will start with the base url:

https://api.lookli.st/v1/

## Format

All responses are in JSON format and depending on the endpoint are either an object (image, user, etc.) or a status response.
